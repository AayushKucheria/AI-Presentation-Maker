- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or use it as a template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-slides-template.git
cd ai-slides-template
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your presentation.

## Creating Your Presentation

1. **Add your content**:
   - Place your content in the `docs/` folder
   - Edit `docs/context.md` with your presentation content
   - Modify `docs/guidelines.txt` with your design preferences
   - Add images to `docs/images/` if needed

2. **Collaborate with AI**:
   - Use Claude in Cursor with Agent Mode enabled
   - Ask Claude to help you update the slides based on your content

3. **Customize your slides**:
   - Modify slide components in `src/components/`
   - Adjust colors, layouts, and styling to match your preferences
   - Preview changes in real-time with the development server

4. **Deploy your presentation**:
   - Run `npm run deploy` to build for production
   - Follow the instructions in the "Publishing" section to deploy to GitHub Pages

## How It Works

This template uses:

- **Next.js** for the React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **AI assistance** via Claude in Cursor

The workflow encourages a document-first approach where you focus on your content, and AI helps transform it into a polished presentation.
