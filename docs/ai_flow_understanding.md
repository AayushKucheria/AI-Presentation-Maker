# How to Use AI to Create Effective Presentations

This document explains how to use this template with AI assistance to create high-quality presentations efficiently. This workflow combines your knowledge and content with AI's ability to help organize, structure, and design visual presentations.

## The AI-Powered Presentation Workflow

### 1. Gather Your Content

Start by collecting all the material you want to include in your presentation:

- Research findings, data, and key statistics
- Main ideas and supporting points
- Examples, case studies, or stories
- Visual assets you want to include (images, diagrams, etc.)

Place all of this content in the `docs/` folder. You can use the provided template files:

- `context.md` - For your main content and structure
- `guidelines.txt` - For design preferences and presentation guidelines
- `images/` - For any visual assets

### 2. Collaborate with AI

With your content prepared, you can now work with Claude through Cursor's Agent Mode:

1. Open the project in Cursor
2. Enable Agent Mode
3. Ask Claude to help you create your presentation based on your content

Example prompts to get started:

```
"Please read through my content in the docs folder and help me structure a presentation with 6 slides."

"Based on my content in context.md, could you help me update the slide components to create a presentation about [your topic]?"

"I'd like to create a presentation with a [modern/corporate/academic] style. Could you help me update the slide components with my content from the docs folder?"
```

### 3. Refine and Iterate

Work with Claude in a conversational manner to refine your slides:

- Ask for specific changes to layouts, colors, or typography
- Request help with visualizing complex information
- Get suggestions for improving flow and narrative
- Iterate until your presentation meets your needs

Example refinement prompts:

```
"The second slide feels too text-heavy. Could you suggest a more visual approach?"

"Could you help me create a diagram for the concept I described in section 2?"

"I'd like to use a different color scheme. Could you update the slides to use blue and orange as primary colors?"
```

### 4. Preview and Finalize

Once you're satisfied with the slides:

1. Run the presentation locally with `npm run dev`
2. Review how it looks and functions
3. Make any final adjustments
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages or your preferred hosting

## Tips for Effective AI Collaboration

1. **Be specific about your needs**: The more detailed your guidance, the better the results.

2. **Think visually**: Describe the visual elements you want, even if you can't create them yourself.

3. **Provide feedback**: If something doesn't work, explain why and suggest alternatives.

4. **Remember your expertise**: You know your content best. AI is here to help present it effectively, not replace your knowledge.

5. **Iterate**: The best presentations often come from multiple rounds of refinement.

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow example:

1. You add your research paper to `docs/context.md`
2. You specify preferences in `guidelines.txt` (modern style, data-focused)
3. You ask Claude to create slides based on your paper
4. Claude helps update the slide components with your content
5. You review and request changes to improve clarity
6. You iterate until satisfied
7. You deploy the final presentation to GitHub Pages

This approach combines your expertise with AI assistance to create presentations that are both high-quality and uniquely yours.
